# System Patterns

*This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.*

## System Architecture

*(Provide a high-level overview of the system's structure. Diagrams like Mermaid can be useful here)*

## Key Technical Decisions

*(List major architectural choices and their rationale)*

## Design Patterns

*(Identify and describe the core design patterns employed in the codebase)*

## Component Relationships

*(Explain how different parts of the system interact)*

## Critical Implementation Paths

*(Highlight key workflows or data flows within the system)*
