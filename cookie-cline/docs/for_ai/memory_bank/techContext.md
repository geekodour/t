# Tech Context

*This file outlines the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns. We can have multiple aspects of things going on, sometime it might even be monorepo setup where we'd have backend and frontend, mobile in the same repo etc. Create appropriate subsection as per requirement when needed*

## Technologies Used

*(List the primary languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, etc.)*

## Development Setup

*(Describe how to set up the development environment, including necessary tools and configurations)*

## Technical Constraints

*(Identify any limitations or constraints impacting development, e.g., performance requirements, browser compatibility, platform restrictions)*

## Dependencies

*(List key external services or systems the project relies on)*

## Tool Usage Patterns

*(Describe common workflows or patterns related to development tools, e.g., version control, build process, testing frameworks)*

## Components/Code Organization
